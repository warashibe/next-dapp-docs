## How to add new pages

The simplest way to add a page is to create a markdown file under [/docs](https://github.com/warashibe/next-dapp-docs/tree/master/docs) directory with an arbitrary file name. Mimic the header format of the other md files in the directory to define `id`, `title` and `sidebar_label`.

For example: 

```md
---
id: api
title: API Reference
sidebar_label: API Refenence
---

Coming Soon...

```

Then Add the doc `id` to [/website/sidebars.json](https://github.com/warashibe/next-dapp-docs/blob/master/website/sidebars.json) in a desired place to include a link the sidebar. You need to restart the local app to reflext the `sidebar.json` changes.

`[Cntr] + C` to kill the app and `yarn start` to restart the local server.

Other than that, refer to [Create Pages](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/tutorial-create-pages) in the Docusaurus Docs.
